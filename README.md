# Timetable Scheduler
> A genetic algorithm for scheduling university class timetable 

## Description
- Implemented a genetic algorithm for scheduling university class timetable with constraints.
- Designed algorithm using test driven design and incorporated parallel processing to optimize its performance.
- This is a variant of constraint satisfaction problem. In these type of problems,there is a set of variables that need to be assigned in a way that they avoid violating a set of constraints.
- While scheduling a timetable we have to consider many constraints. Like the classes should not clash or one professor cannot be in two places at the same time.
